The goal of this project is to create a Python program that will check whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

Input:

The user will be prompted to enter a word or phrase.
Output:

The program will output a message indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.
Example Input:
"racecar"

Example Output:
"racecar is a palindrome!"

Example Input:
"Hello World"

Example Output:
"Hello World is not a palindrome."

Project Steps:

Ask the user to input a word or phrase.
Remove any spaces and punctuation from the input and convert it to all lowercase letters.
Reverse the input and compare it to the original input.
If the reversed input is the same as the original input, output a message indicating that it is a palindrome. Otherwise, output a message indicating that it is not a palindrome.
